#NLS (National Language System) array.

#The basic idea and values was taken from then Horde Framework (http://horde.org)
#The original filename was horde/config/nls.php.
#The modifications to fit it for Gallery were made by Jens Tkotz
#(http://gallery.meanalto.com) 

#Ideas from Gallery's implementation made to CMS by Ted Kulp
