Version 1.4 "Jamaica"
-----------------
- Includes a new system information page in the admin
  * Many thanks to Alby, and others
- Smarty now works as you would expect in the admin
  * Any new or rewritten pages in the admin are using this
  * This may break pisearch plugin, etc
- A completely new way of page template processing.
  * We split the template into three pieces
    a) Any text ontop of <head>
    b) The <head> section
    c) the rest of the template (the body)
  * We then process the top section through smarty, then the body, and finally the head.  Then we glue it back together.  This will allow variables set in page content or in various module templates to be used in the head section to effect such things as meta tags, and page titles.
  * A new text area in the options tab of content pages allows specifying page specific data (as opposed to putting page specific data into the metadata section of the page)
  * A new plugin {process_pagedata} processes the page specific data through
    smarty.  It should be at the very top of all page templates
  * On new install, all page templates have {process_pagedata} at the very top.
  * This may break sites that have used some of my tricks to 
    change the page title based on news or other modules content
    so it will be off by default after release, and on for the beta
- Memory optimizations, and query optimizations: We've done a few checks, and improved a few things here and there that will provide a modest boost in performance.
  * FileManager is now an admin only module
  * nuSOAP is now an admin only module (for most sites).
  * more in memory caching
- Massive improvement in stylesheet handling: It is now possible to allow or deny browser stylesheet caching. Stylesheets are now re-orderable
- Updates to the admin menu structure: Main is now called CMS, and the logout and view site links are under there.
- Theme Improvements
  * Many thanks to Nuno
  * New icons for view site and logout
- Cleaned up and improved Module Manager.  It should be much faster and leaner now.
- Minor improvements to CMSMailer
- Improvements to the Installer
  * Many thanks to Alby
  * The installer is now fully translatable, so you can choose what
    language you want the installer pages to appear in
  * Many more checks have been added and re-organized to hopefully
    solve some of the issues people have with installation.
    - Safe mode is still a warning, however we do a required check to see if the httpd server process can create a file within a directory it created.  This should help track problems with safe mode enabled when php is running as an apache module (which we do not support).
- We now ship a full distribution as well as an english only version and several 'language packs'.
- NCleanGrey is now the default admin theme.
- you can now specify default text for additional content blocks in page templates.
- A new permission that controls access to the Tags page so that editors, etc. can see the help there.

  * Many thanks to _SjG_
- Updates to the embed plugin
- Add three new page attributes to content, PageLink, Link, and SectionHeader content types
- Modify the menu manager to export the new page attributes.  This will be useful for permissions, or meta data or other tags.
- FileManager gained recursive chmodding, custom sorting and saner permission handling in windows
- Printing updated to latest TCPDF release 4.0 including rewritten html rendering code
- TinyMCE got updated and some css-related issues were fixed
- Search Improvements 
  * Minor performance tweaks to Search Re-indexing
  * Now escape any characters that have special importance in regular expressions before performing the search
  * Restore the template to it's pre-1.5 behavior whils till retaining the new functionality.
- Now remind the user to configure their mail settings
- A new admin function to check the current install against either a release-generated checksum file or a previously downloaded checksum file.  This will help to find upload errors, or to find files that have been modified since the last known good state, to aid in detecting hacks.
- News has had minor tweaks
  * Now handle the old pretty urls as well as the new ones
    i.e;  News/<newsid>/<pageid> will work just as well as 
          News/<newsid>/<pageid>/<article-title>
  * A new icon for rss feeds
- Though it's not really a 1.4 issue, the Translation center has been fixed (many many thanks to the regex guro _SjG_) so that links will work in translated files.  We essentially translate all quotes inside of <a> tags to a special string, then do the html entity stuff, then translate that special string back to quotes.  Translators need to go through and update ALL translations.

Version 1.0 "Hawaii" -- Sep 10 2006
-----------------

* Events

  A workflow system.  Events are generated either by the core, or by a module
  and can be handled either by other modules, or by User Defined Tags.  The 
  administrator can add, remove, or re-order any of the event handlers
  for a particular event.  This functionality allows site administrators to
  add custom behavior and workflow to their system that have not been
  coded directly into the core or into other third party modules.
  
  For example, with a simple user defined Tag, it is now possible for
  a news article to automatically be added whenever a file is uploaded
  in the Uploads module.

* Search

  A brand new search module has been written that allows indexing of content,
  excluding certain words, and unlimited customization.  It is possible for 
  third party module developers to write some code into their modules to 
  allow searching of module content.

* Module Manager
  
  The module manager allows querying, and installing of modules hosted
  on a remote server.  The Module Manager allows an administrator to
  see the help, and about information, the dependencies, and other
  details of a module before downloading it.
 
* Module List Improvements

  The Module list as been optimized and some new functionality added:
  - Core modules can no longer be exported to XML
  - Only installed third party modules can be exported to XML
  - There is an option to completely remove all of the module files
    after a module has been uninstalled (if sufficient permissions exist).
  - A check is done for permissions to indicate that there may be a 
    problem removing the files.
 
* Improved Installer
       
  The installer has been given some tweaks, and some additional checks
  to hopefully ward off some of the more common installation issues, and
  to ensure that most of the functionality of CMS will work properly
  after installation.

* Simplified Default Stylesheets

  The default stylesheets have been simplified and documented, so that
  it is (hopefully) easier for somebody to start modifying their site
  given the standard stylesheets

* Improved default templates and content

  The default templates and content have been improved in appearance and
  in content, and thoroughly documented.

* Improved content list

  Content list has been given an overhaul:
  - Active, Default, Collapse and Move buttons now work via AJAX calls 
    for faster response.
  - A drag and drop reodering system
  - Reordering boxes for the css/javascript impaired

* AJAX Content Preview

  The preview has been moved to a tab and will update as soon as you click
  on it.

* Admin interface improvements

  The appearance of the admin interface has been improved significantly.
  There are now help links in each module and in other core locations that 
  will link back to the wiki.

* New default layouts

  tested with all major browsers (including Internet Explorer 7 beta 3)
  Styles and templates now have comments so editing is easier
  sample stylesheets for handheld devices and print

* Improved plugins

  The image, cms_selflink, anchor, breadcrumbs, and other plugins have all 
  been improved, and other plugins added, such as "recently_updated"

* New System Modules

  nuSOAP and CMSMailer are now included in the default install, since so 
  many modules rely on them for basic functionality.

* Upgraded smarty to 2.6.14

* Upgrade ADODB Lite to 1.20

  CMSMS doesn't require that adodb or adodb lite be modified anymore.  If you need a different 
  version, just download from their site and you're good to go.

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

  Modules that use timestamps, or that use the RowCount() method in CMS 0.13 or 
  earlier, will need to be upgraded.  This accounts for a large majority of modules and 
  hopefully new versions of most modules will be out by the final release.

* Some of the bigger bugs that were fixed

  - Fixed a bug in the metadata tag where showbase would default to false, even when 
    it should be true
  - Fixed a bug with displaying a few admin images
  - Fixed most of the -- Add Me -- messages when using other languages besides the default
    one for that module

  allow overriding the default hardcoded URL to check for a new version, or to
  disable checking all together.  The second will force clearing all cached information
  and result in a version check occurring the next time the 'main' section of the
  admin panel is accessed.
